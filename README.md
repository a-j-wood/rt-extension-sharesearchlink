# RT::Extension::ShareSearchLink

This extension adds a "*Share a link*" item to the *Tools* menu on the
search results page, and a similar button at the bottom of the search
results.

The "*Share a link*" menu item or button will show a pop-up box containing
a short link to this search, with all the search terms and formatting stored
in a database entry in RT.

This is useful when your search URL is very long.
